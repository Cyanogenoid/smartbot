# Smart Bot

_A supposedly smart IRC bot._

Smart Bot is a very thin wrapper around the excellent [node IRC library][0]. It
is very loosely based on Hubot in the sense that it uses a similar plugin API.

The logic of the bot is controlled using plugins.

## Configuration

The configuration file is a very simple and self-explanatory JSON based config.
Before you run the bot you must create a configuration file similar to this.

	{
		"irc": {
			"server": "my.irc.server.com",
			"port": 6667,
			"nick": "SmartBot",
			"username": "SmartBot",
			"realname": "The one and only bot"
		},

		"plugins": {
			"autojoin": [ "#channel1", "#channel2" ],
			"websites": null,
			"google": { "key": "mygooglekey", "cx": "mycxkey" },
			"encoding": null,
			"hashing": null,
			"xkcd": null,
			"wolfram": "mywolframkey",
			"remind": null
		}

	}
